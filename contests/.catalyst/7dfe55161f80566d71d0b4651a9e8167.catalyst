Permutation Minimization by Deque","contestId":"1579","problemIndex":"E1","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.</span></p><p>A permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is given. A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">permutation</span> of size $$$n$$$ is an array of size $$$n$$$ in which each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once. For example, $$$[1, 4, 3, 2]$$$ and $$$[4, 2, 1, 3]$$$ are correct permutations while $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 2]$$$ are not.</p><p>Let us consider an empty <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux\">deque</a> (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements $$$[1, 5, 2]$$$ currently in the deque, adding an element $$$4$$$ to the beginning will produce the sequence $$$[\\color{red}{4}, 1, 5, 2]$$$, and adding same element to the end will produce $$$[1, 5, 2, \\color{red}{4}]$$$.</p><p>The elements of the permutation are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with $$$p_1$$$ and finishing with $$$p_n$$$. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or the end.</p><p>For example, if we consider a permutation $$$p = [3, 1, 2, 4]$$$, one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this: </p><table class=\"tex-tabular\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 1.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$3$$$ to the end of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[\\color{red}{3}]$$$ in it;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 2.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$1$$$ to the beginning of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[\\color{red}{1}, 3]$$$ in it;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 3.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$2$$$ to the end of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[1, 3, \\color{red}{2}]$$$ in it;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 4.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$4$$$ to the end of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[1, 3, 2, \\color{red}{4}]$$$ in it;</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Find the lexicographically smallest possible sequence of elements in the deque after the entire permutation has been processed. </p><p>A sequence $$$[x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n]$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">lexicographically smaller</span> than the sequence $$$[y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n]$$$ if there exists such $$$i \\leq n$$$ that $$$x_1 = y_1$$$, $$$x_2 = y_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1}$$$ and $$$x_i &lt; y_i$$$. In other words, if the sequences $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ have some (possibly empty) matching prefix, and the next element of the sequence $$$x$$$ is strictly smaller than the corresponding element of the sequence $$$y$$$. For example, the sequence $$$[1, 3, 2, 4]$$$ is smaller than the sequence $$$[1, 3, 4, 2]$$$ because after the two matching elements $$$[1, 3]$$$ in the start the first sequence has an element $$$2$$$ which is smaller than the corresponding element $$$4$$$ in the second sequence.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of the test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case description contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; permutation size.
